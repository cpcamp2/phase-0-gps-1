1. Git concepts I struggled with were pushing featured branches directly to GitHub for a pull request. It took some practice before becoming more proficent.

2. Unforunately, I missed my GPS 1.1 session because I mixed up 12 am and pm. I thought I signed up for a class at noon instead of midnight so I didn't get the opportunity to get clarity. It was a pretty dumb mistake on my part.

3. I would of asked my pair or guide about pushing and merging remote branches and how that works. Also, clarity about code blocks. I used my code block to use html to show a link. I'm not sure if my inline screenshot worked so I would of also asked where to find the interpreter for GitHub markdown. 

4. The remote branches and how it works with a partner.

5. I was pretty disappointed to miss it. I was looking forward to doing the GPS before my peer pairing sessions to get a feel for how to pair with the safety net of a guide.
